			<h3>Irle Goldman - <small>Counseling and Psych</small></h3>
			<p>Thank you for doing this union organizing.</p>

<p>I have been an adjunct at Lesley in Counseling and Psych and Expressive Therapies and Lesley-Israel for over 20 years. I have also been on core for a couple of years. I much prefer to be an adjunct....I get to do what I love to do without having the distractions and frustrations of the dynamics of the institution.</p>

<p>The reason I'm so excited about the organizing efforts is that it can give us adjuncts a community, and empowerment, an organization.</p>

<p>As an adjunct you never know til you get that call or email whether you have a job for the semesters to come. You rarely know the other teachers who are teaching the same material in the next classroom. You have little impact on which room you will teach in or whether your AV needs will be met. You feel like you are often floating in space without the assurance of a tether line.</p>

<p>May our organizing be successful and empowering.</p>

			<h3>Current Adjunct - <small>Expressive Therapies</small></h3>
<p>This time of year the story is very busy.  Teaching the clinical courses for the graduate program means a five page evaluation for each student.  For me, with both courses that I teach, that is 60 extra pages of writing and then meeting with each student for 30 minutes to go over their evaluation.  This is on top of the end of the semester papers that are graded outside of class time.  Students have told me how helpful and important these evaluations are to their process of learning and owning their strengths and growing edges in their clinical careers.  So it is not something that I want to rush.  But it is something that I have to squeeze into spare moments of the day.</p>  <p>Also this is the time of year when students' challenges are coming up at their internship sites.  So much of my days are spent calling site supervisors, extra meeting times and phone calls with the field training office to support students through this challenging time for them. I work with an amazing team in my department and we are extremely dedicated to supporting the students in their process.  I don't think we realize just how much extra time we give. </p>

			<h3>Smiley - <small>CAL</small></h3>
			<p>Thank you for doing this union organizing.</p>

<p>Here is an "evening in the life.."</p>

<p>It's winter, February and it has been snowing lightly. I'm at home a few hours before my media literacy class. We're doing stop motion animation for the final projects. There's a fork in the road here..</p>

<p>I want to demo a small table top animation setup with lights for the students. The reason I want to do this is that every time I have done it in the past, the student work has been much better. They don't cheat on the lighting, and in seeing me model something they are able to come up with their own home setups for animation.</p>

<p>Here's the fork in the road. It would be a LOT easier if I just showed a youtube video about how to do it and answered questions. I know personally that it won't have the same impact.</p>

<p>OK. I was going to bike to my class (it's not snowing hard and I have bike lights and a helmet) but I'll take the car and my setup instead.</p>

<p>Then I'm faced with a dilemma. There's not parking on main campus near my classroom. I've already gotten one Cambridge parking ticket this semester. One solution is to drop the gear off at security, and do my usual parking workaround..I'm a Somerville resident so I park up near University Hall on the Somerville side of things. However, I don't want to leave my gear at security..no offense but that's not really their job and their office is pretty busy..no place to lock it up.</p>

<p>Ok, so plan B. I get my grocery cart, pad it with a blanket on the bottom, pack my gear, and put it in the cart. I load that into my car. I park near U-Hall. </p>

<p>Here's another fork in the road. Do I actually go bumpily bump with the grocery cart down the darker, brick walkway or take the longer smoother route on Mass Ave? I go for Mass Ave. It is also slightly less noisy that way.</p>

<p>I teach the class. The class is much better with my gear set up. I really think it helps students think their own sets through at home. Later on I will email them the youtube video.</p>

<p>I finish class, and I realize that I am going to have to move my gear with my little grocery cart at 9:15 PM at night in the darkness in February. Duh. I definitely don't want to get mugged with this stuff. I ask a student who is walking to Porter Square to walk with me. I have to get a cart that has rubber wheels or something, this is really loud. But at least maybe people think I have groceries and not 400.00 worth of animation gear.</p>

<p>Was it worth it? from a teaching perspective of course. I'm just not sure if I can keep doing it this way. It would be easier to show that youtube video.</p>

			<h3>Current Adjunct - <small>School of Education</small></h3>
			<p>As a new member of the Adjunct Faculty, but a former Lesley student, I am truly honored to be teaching a course where I get to interact with current students and future teacher leaders.  I currently work full-time as a special educator at a local elementary school and therefore am able to include current practices, research, and guest speakers to my class.  Since I am teaching a night course, I usually finish work, attend a professional development session at my school, rush home to eat, and then head early to Lesley in order to prepare for class and meet with students when possible. </p>
			<p> I communicate mostly through email and some phone calls with my students, but would prefer face-to-face time rather than a quick chat before class, during break or after class. Overall, I am happy with the support received from the University and view it as a strength to be able to hire professionals in the field.  They bring a unique perspective and diversity to this esteemed University.  </p>

			<h3>Matthew White - <small>College of Art and Design</small></h3>
			<p>On a typical day this Fall 2013 semester, I am up at 7am. I drive my wife to work from Medford to Boston, and come back to Medford to work on client projects and prep for the day's courses. (I am a web designer and developer). Around noon, I drive back to the Boston campus and typically hit the local burrito place for a quick lunch in Kenmore Square.</p>

<p>I teach courses from 1pm to 6:40pm, two courses back-to-back, with only about 5-10 minutes in between classes to take a break. Students from the next course are often waiting outside my classroom to get in, and I end up having to cut student questions short due to scheduling and time constraints. I try and have students email me questions, but it does not always work out, and important questions and issues addressed after class could get lost in the shuffle.</p>

<p>That is Monday and Wednesday.</p>

<p>On Tuesdays, the morning schedule is the same, but at noon I leave to teach at Northeastern University. I tend to park at my wife's work, which is not preferred by her office, and walk a mile to the NEU campus. Parking at NEU is expensive (upwards of $30 per day without a parking voucher, which adjuncts do not have access to). At 5pm, class is over and I come back home and prep for the next days course.</p>

<p>I often end up working at night, until late hours, replying to emails from students and grading assignments / projects. I am only compensated for credit hours as far as I can tell, and spend many hours a week prepping, grading and communicating with students.</p>

				<h3 name="jcowens">J.C. Owens - <small>Former Adjunct at Lesley</small></h3>
			
					<p>To: Provost Williams, Lesley University
				<p>
				CC: President Moore, Lesley University <br />
				CC: Ian Adelman, Service Employees International Union<br />
				CC: Leigh Moyer, Service Employees International Union<br />
				
				<p>
				I received a letter by mail from your office today that I believe came to me by mistake. It was addressed to "colleague" as though I am still a member of your faculty. This is the letter describing the Service Employees International Union's intent to establish a collective bargaining unit with the cooperation of the part-time faculty* at Lesley University.<p>
				
				I'd like to state, for the purposes of identifying myself, that I am no longer a member of your part-time faculty. I have not taught at Lesley since the beginning of June of this year and I am not under contract to teach any classes this fall nor am I teaching classes this Spring. Further, I'd like to state for the purposes of this letter that I have no intentions of teaching at your great institution anytime in the near future. 
				<p>
				Please take my name off your list immediately. 
				<p>
				I believe the letter I received today was meant to falsely represent the number of part-time faculty in favor of the University's anti-union position. Theoretically, if people like me, who no longer teach at the school, receive this letter I might throw it away and you include my name amongst the number people who did not sign the petition or order a card from the union. This would artificially inflate the number of people who are not in favor of unionizing.
				<p>
				As a result, this letter of yours is a brash and violent attack on the very idea of collective bargaining  and you should be ashamed of yourself. 
				<p>
				Unionizing is a benefit to everyone. The United Nations supports collective bargaining in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights under article 23 section 4: "Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests." You should too. 
				<p>
				I currently teach at two institutions that have long-standing unions. These schools have more predictable and favorable pay scales and benefits packages for part-time faculty than Lesley. The union fees are negligible compared to the offering. The people who represent me have contracts similar to my own and are more likely to understand my financial and medical concerns as part-time faculty. In short, I trust the union and I feel more secure because of that trust.
				<p>
				This goes beyond pay and benefits alone. As it currently stands, part-time faculty are at the mercy of department heads and deans for for matters such as disciplinary hearings that involve either themselves, their students, their department heads and deans, or some combination thereof. Having a union representative present during disciplinary meetings would provide a part-timer with the means to due process. 
				<p>
				It is my belief that the unionization of Lesley part-timers would only help the long-term health of the community and provide stability to the very people who have supported its rapid expansion over the years.
				<p>
				I wish the SEIU all the best in its efforts to bring collective bargaining to the part-time faculty to Lesley,
				<p>
				J.C. Owens
				<p>

				<p>
				* I say part-time faculty instead of adjunct because according to the Oxford English Dictionary adjunct means "a thing added to something else as a supplementary rather than an essential part." I beg to differ. If schools were to have no part-time faculty they would find themselves at a serious disadvantage. Therefore, "adjunct" is a derogatory term.
